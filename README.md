# MP-Microtia-Website
## Purpose
To develop a comprehensive website dedicated to providing information and support for individuals
seeking reconstruction for microtia and other ear-related surgeries. The site will aim to educate visitors
on treatment options, potentially pre- and post-care, and direct patients to two websites to schedule:
CHOC website (for pediatric patients): https://www.choc.org/programs-services/plastic-surgery/ear-
anomalies-program/UCI website (for adult patients; I only see patients at the Orange and Costa Mesa clinic offices):
https://www.uciplasticsurgery.com/contact/

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind
- Backend: .NET
- Hosted on Azure Cloud

## Scope
The project encompasses the creation of a detailed, user-friendly website that combines educational
content and interactive features to educate users about the different reconstructive and non-surgical
options for reconstruction. This website will not be an interface to book patients. All patients will be
referred to the links to schedule consults. I do not want to leverage UCI or CHOC on this website – this is
necessary to avoid any conflicts.

## Objectives
- Educate users on microtia and common ear anomalies.
- Educate users on the different options for
treatment.
- Provide an understanding of what surgery entails.
- Direct patients to both links to schedule
appointments.

## Website Requirements
- Responsive design for accessibility on various devices.
- Clear, intuitive navigation with categories for treatments, patient resources, and contact information.
- Interactive FAQ section addressing common questions about microtia and ear surgery.
- Detailed profiles for each surgeon, including credentials, specialties, and patient reviews.
- Integration of multimedia content to showcase work and approach to surgery.
  
## Security and Privacy
- No patient information is to be transmitted on this website.
  
## Performance
- Optimized for speed and performance, aiming for fast page loading times.
- Regular performance monitoring and updates to maintain optimal site speed.
  
## SEO and Marketing
- SEO-optimized content and structure to rank highly for microtia and ear surgery-related searches.
- Integration with social media for easy sharing of content.
- Implementation of a blog for ongoing content marketing and patient education.
- We will need to integrate SEO terms as often as possible.

## Scalability
- Design and infrastructure that supports future expansion of content, features, and user traffic – I just
want to be able to update it and add text.

- Built with a modern web framework that supports responsive design
- Cross-browser compatibility with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Hosting solution with guaranteed uptime, regular backups, and scalability options.
